Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: We might consider using Git because Git has many functionalities such as version control which makes it easier for a user to revert a files back to previous versions if something breaks. This also means that the user has a record of changes made which can help the user keep track of their progress. Another reason why we might consider using Git is because it is great for collaboration. Multiple users can collaborate on a project by pushing and modifying existing files without the concern of overwriting other users' work. With just a few terminal commands users can push files to a git repository which highlights just how easy it is to use Git.



Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data Science can be applied to the field of Artificial Intelligence(AI). One area of AI is Machine Learning where Data Science is used to help clean data and create datasets from which ML models can use to identify patterns.


Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: The first difference between merging and rebasing is that they have different terminal commands. Also merging merges two branches while rebasing essentially replays the changes made from one branch onto another branch.


Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I am looking forward to learning more about Data Science and also improving my ability to clean data and create datasets that can be used by ML models to identify patterns.
